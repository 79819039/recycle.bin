**Recycle Bin**

This plugin adds a Recycle Bin to hold samba deleted files until you empty the trash either manually or on a weekly schedule.  A share is created that is called "RecycleBin" that you can access by "//Tower/RecycleBin" for any files that have been deleted through a samba share.  You can restore the deleted files from the "RecycleBin" share.  The User 'admin' has access to the "RecycleBin", but other Users can be added.  If you remove the plugin, all deleted files will be kept int the "RecycleBin" share.  You will have to empty the trash before the plugin is removed or remove the deleted files manually.
