**Recycle Bin**

This plugin adds recycle bin functionallity to hold samba deleted files until you empty the trash either manually or on a weekly schedule.  A share is created that is called "RecycleBin" that you can access by "//Tower/RecycleBin" for any files that have been deleted through a samba share.  You can restore the deleted files from the "RecycleBin" share.  The only User with access to the "RecycleBin" is 'admin'.  If you remove the plugin, all deleted files will be removed from the "RecycleBin" share.
