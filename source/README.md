**Recycle Bin**

This plugin adds a Recycle Bin to hold samba deleted files until you empty the trash either manually or on a weekly schedule.  A share is created that is called RecycleBin that you can access by //Tower/RecycleBin for any files that have been deleted through a samba share.  You can restore the deleted files from the RecycleBin share.  The User 'admin' has access to the RecycleBin, but other Users can be added.  If you want to remove the plugin, all deleted files will be kept in the RecycleBin folders on the disks.  You will have to empty the trash before the plugin is removed.
