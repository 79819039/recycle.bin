**Recycle Bin**

This plugin adds a per share Recycle Bin to hold samba deleted files until you empty the trash either manually or on a weekly schedule.  A .Recycle.Bin directory is created in each share that you can access by //Tower/Share/.Recycle.Bin for any files that have been deleted through a samba share.  You can restore the deleted files from the .Recycle.Bin.  The User access to the .Recycle.Bin directory is the same as the User share access.  If you want to remove the plugin, all deleted files will be kept in the share .Recycle.Bin folders.  You will have to empty the trash before the plugin is removed.
